# ietoolkit

To be exapnded. Initiated at publication of version 2.0

ietookit provides a set of commands that address different aspects of data management and data analysis in relation to Impact Evaluations. The list of commands will be extended continuously, and suggestions on new commands are highly appreciated. Some of the commands are related to standardized practices developed at DIME (The World Bankâ€™s unit for Impact Evaluations, DECIE) and might not apply to practices adopted at other institutions. For these commands, the corresponding help files provide justifications for the standardized practices applied. ieduplicates and iecompdup are useful tools to identify and correct for duplicates. iebaltab is a tool for multiple treatment arm balance tables. ieboilstart and ieboilsave standardizes the boilerplate code at the top of all do-files and the checks applied before saving a data set.
