# How to contribute
If you aree familiar with how GitHub please feel free to make a fork and sumbitt a pull request for any additions you want to make. If you are new to GitHub, start by reading the **Bug reports and feature requests** section below. 

## Bug reports and feature requests
An easy but still very efficient way to provide any feedback on these commands that does not require any GitHub knowledge is to create an *issue* . You can read *issues* submitted by other users or create a new *issue*  [here](https://github.com/worldbank/ietoolkit/issues). While the word *issue* has a negative connotation outside GitHub, it can be used for any kind of feedback. If you have an idea for a new command, or a new feature on an existing command, creating an *issue* is a great tool for suggesting that. Please read already existing *issues* to check whether someone else has made the same suggestion or reported the same error before creating a new *issue*.

# ietoolkit contribution conventions

## Commit message conventions

If your commit ios specific to a command, then always start with that command name for example `iefolder: fix typo in error message`

## Working with solutions to issues

When you start working on the solution to a new issue, then create a new branch named after the issue, for example `fix issue #122`. If you want feedback on your solution to the issue or help with testing it, then ask for that before you merge the fix to the `develop` branch.
