### Title
'IETOOLKIT': module providing commands specially developed for Impact Evaluations

### Description

ietookit provides a set of commands that address different aspects of data management and data analysis in relation to Impact Evaluations. The list of commands will be extended continuously, and suggestions on new commands are highly appreciated. Some of the commands are related to standardized practices developed at the World Bank's unit for Impact Evaluations (DIME) and might not apply to practices adopted at other institutions. For these commands, the corresponding help files provide justifications for the standardized practices applied. ieduplicates and iecompdup are useful tools to identify and correct for duplicates. iebaltab is a tool for multiple treatment arm balance tables. ieboilstart standardizes the boilerplate code at the top of all do-files. iegraph produces graphs based on common impact evaluation regression models. See https://github.com/worldbank/ietoolkit for more details.

### What are keywords?
This is an explanation to the keywords used below. I do not know how frequently they are used, but this is a list of keywords that are searchable. So if you search on _field work_ (but I do not know where you do that search) you should find this command as it is one of the keywords.
